# Lesson 1

## General presentation of Data Science

General concept of data science: Extracting *knowledge* and *insights*
from data. There is a huge variety of methods to do it, ranging from
basic statistics to deep neural networks.

Machine learning systems learn how to combine *input* to produce
useful *predictions* on *never-before-seen* data.

General concepts of machine learning:
  - Labels: A *label* is the thing we're predicting - the `y` variable
    in simple linear regression (_y = ax + b_). The label could be the
    future price of wheat, the kind of animal shown in a picture, the
    meaning of an audio clip, or just about anything.
  - Features: A *feature* is an input variable - the `x` variable in a
    simple linear regression (_y = ax + b_). A simple machine learning
    project might use a single feature, while a more sophisticated
    machine learning project could use millions of features, specified
    as: _x<sub>1</sub>_,_x<sub>2</sub>_, ..., _x<sub>n</sub>_.
  - Models: A *model* defines the relationship between features and
    label - `ax + b` in a simple linear regression (_y = ax + b_). For
    example, a spam detection model might associate certain features
    strongly with "spam". Let's highlight two phases of a model's
    life. *Training* means creating or *learning* the model. That is,
    you show the model labeled examples and enable the model to
    gradually learn the relationship between features and label. In
    the case of a linear regression, it consists in finding "good"
    values for `a` and `b`, the *parameters* of the model. *Inference*
    means applying the trained model to unlabeled examples. That is,
    you use the trained model to make useful predictions (`y'`). For
    example, during inference, you can predict for a new incoming mail
    whether it is spam or not.
  - Supervised learning: In *supervised* learning, we model the
    relationship input and output. Depending on the type of
    values predicted by the model, we call it either a
    *regression* model or a *classification* model. A regression
    model predicts continuous values. For example, regression
    models make predictions that answer questions like "What is
    the value of a house in California?" or "What is the
    probability that a user will click on this ad?". A
    classification model predicts discrete values. For example,
    classification models make predictions that answer questions
    like "Is a given message spam or not spam?" or "Is this an
    image of a dog, a cat, or a hamster?".
  - Unsupervised learning: In *unsupervised* learning, we model
    the features of a dataset without reference to any label. It
    is often described as "letting the dataset speak for
    itself". These type of machine learning model include tasks
    such as *clustering* or *dimensionality
    reduction*. Clustering algorithms identify distinct groups
    of data while dimensionality reduction algorithms search for
    a more succinct representations of the data.
  - There exist more learning paradigms such as [Reinforcement
    learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning)
    (AlphaGo), [Semi-supervised
    learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-supervised_learning)
    (hybrid between supervised and unsupervised) and
    [Self-supervised
    learning](https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2019/11/10/self-supervised-learning.html)
    (a kind of unsupervised learning in which we use the data
    itself to create a "virtual" supervision, an example of
    self-supervised model would be a learned
    compressor-decompressor).

## Deep learning

Deep learning is a part of machine learning methods based on
*artificial neural networks*. Artificial neural networks are a family
of computation models _vaguely_ inspired by the biological neural
networks that constitute animal brains. We will go briefly over the
history of this discipline and then study the example of the linear
regression. While not a neural network per se, understanding all its
concepts should give a very solid base for studying deep neural
networks.

## Linear regression

Inspired by [ML crash course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/descending-into-ml/training-and-loss)

Finding "good" parameters `a` and `b` of a line `y = ax + b` to
approximate a set of point is an example of machine learning. The set
of points `(x, y)` is the *dataset* or *training data* of the
problem. In this case, the *model* is a Linear Regression (a line of
equation `y = ax + b`).  Finding "good" parameters for `a` and `b`
using labelled examples is the *training process*, *optimization* or
*learning* of the model and to define what being a "good model" means
we will need a *loss function*.

### Loss function

The *loss function* used to evaluate a model. It penalizes bad
prediction. If the model's prediction is perfect, the loss is zero
otherwise, the loss is greater. The goal of *training* model is to
find a set of parameters (in our case `a` and `b`) that have low loss,
on average, across all examples.

![Two linear regressions](../figures/linear_regression_loss.png)

Notice that the arrows in the left plot are much longer than their
counterparts in the right plot. Clearly, the line in the right plot is
a much better predictive model than the line in the left plot.

You might be wondering whether you could create a mathematical
function - a loss function - that would aggregate the individual
losses in a meaningful fashion.

The linear regression models we'll examine here use a loss function
called *squared loss* (also known as *L<sub>2</sub> loss*). The
squared loss of a model `y' = ax + b` for a single example `(x, y)` is
as follows:

- = the square of the difference between the label and the prediction
- = (observation - prediction(x))<sup>2</sup>
- = (y - y')<sup>2</sup>
- = (y - (ax + b))<sup>2</sup>
- = (y - ax - b) <sup>2</sup>

*Mean square error (MSE)* is the average squared loss per example over
the whole dataset. To calculate MSE, sum up all the squared losses for
individual examples and then divide by the number of examples:

![MSE loss](../figures/mse_loss.gif)

where:
- `(x, y)` is an example in which
    - `x` is the set of features (for example, chirps / minute, age,
      gender) that the model uses to make predictions.
    - `y` is the example's label (for example, temperature).
- `prediction(x)` is a function of the weights and bias in combination
  with the set of features `x`. In our case case `prediction(x) = ax +
  b`.
- `D` is a data set containing many labeled examples, which are `(x,
  y)` pairs.
- `N` is the number of examples in `D`.

Although MSE is commonly-used in machine learning, it is neither the
only practical loss function nor the best loss function for all
circumstances. Because of the squaring operation, a single *large*
difference between a prediction and a label will be penalized more
than many smaller ones.

A *high loss value* signifies that the models' predictions are poor
approximation of the labels. Conversely a *small loss value* means
that our model captures the structure of the data. Now that we know
that, we will take a look at algorithms designed to lower the loss of
a specific model on a specific dataset by modifying its parameters.

### Training algorithms

#### Iterative approach

The procedure that we will use to learn our model is *iterative*. We
start with a random guess for each parameter of our model (here `a`
and `b`), we compute the loss to evaluate how good our current
parameters are and, using this loss, we will compute an update hoping
to lower the loss on the next iteration.

The following figure summarizes the process:

![Gradient Descent Diagram](../figures/gradient_descent_diagram.svg)

To be able to apply this procedure to our problem, we have to find a
way to compute parameters updates.

#### Gradient descent

Suppose we had the time and the computing resources to calculate the
loss for all possible values of `a` (w<sub>1</sub> in the
figures). For the kind of regression problems we have been examining,
the resulting plot of loss vs `a` will always be *convex*. In other
words, the plot will always be bowl-shaped, kind of like this:

![Gradient Descent explanation 1](../figures/gd_01.svg)

Convex problems have only one minimum; that is, only one place where
the *slope* is exactly 0. The minimum is where the loss function
converges.

As computing the loss function for all values of `a` to find its
minimum would be extremely inefficient we need a better
mechanism. Let's examine such an algorithm, the *gradient descent*.

As explained in the previous section, we start with a random guess for
our parameter.

![Gradient Descent explanation 2](../figures/gd_02.svg)

Now that we have an initial value for our parameter `a`, we can
compute the loss value for our linear regression. Next, we would like
to know whether we should *increase* or *decrease* the value of `a` to
make the loss decrease.

To get this information, the gradient descent algorithm calculates the
*gradient* of the loss curve at the current point. In the next Figure,
the gradient of the loss is equal to the derivative (slope) of the
curve and tells you that you should *increase* the value of `a` to
make the loss value decrease.

![Gradient Descent explanation 3](../figures/gd_03.svg)

As the gradient of a curve approximates it well in a very small
neighborhood, we add a small fraction (this fraction is called
*learning rate*) of the gradient magnitude to the starting point.

![Gradient Descent explanation 4](../figures/gd_04.svg)

Now that we have a new (and hopefully better) value for `a`, we
iterate the previous process to improve it even further.

#### Learning rate

The *learning rate* is an *hyperparameter* in this problem, a
*parameter of the training process*, not of the model. It is important
to note that the learning rate (which determines the size of the steps
during the descent process) should neither be too small (otherwise the
training process will take very long to converge) nor too big (which
can lead to the process not converging at all).

[Interactive graph of the learning rate
importance](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/fitter/graph)

#### Gradient descent on many parameters

In the example that we have seen earlier we used the gradient descent
to find the correct value for a single parameter. In cases where we
have more parameters (`a` and `b` for a line equation), we compute the
gradient of the loss function (the derivatives according to each of
the variable) and update them all at once.

Let's compute the gradients of `a` and `b` in our example. First lets
recall and develop the MSE loss formula in our case.

![MSE formula raw](../figures/mse_lin_reg.gif)

Now we want to differentiate this function according to `a` and `b`
separately. Let's start with `a`. In order to simplify the
computation we factor the previous formula by `a`.

![MSE formula a factored](../figures/mse_lin_reg_loss_a.gif)

from there we easily compute the derivative of the loss according to
`a`.

![MSE formula a gradient](../figures/mse_lin_reg_grad_a.gif)

Now onto `b`, we follow a similar process. First we factor by `b`.

![MSE formula b factored](../figures/mse_lin_reg_loss_b.gif)

from there we compute the derivative of `l` according to `b`.

![MSE formula b gradient](../figures/mse_lin_reg_grad_b.gif)

An animation of an application of the gradient descent algorithm on a
linear regression problem can be found [here](../figures/anim_gd.pdf).

#### Stochastic version

In real problems, it is often not practical to compute the value of
the average loss across all of the training set as it often contains a
huge quantity of data.

To deal with this problem, we run the gradient descent using
*batches*. A batch is a subset of the training set (usually 10 to 1000
examples) that we use to compute an approximation of the gradient. The
larger the size of the batches the better the gradient approximation,
the more robust the training procedure is. By using this algorithm, we
trade robustness for efficiency.

#### Takeaways

The main takeaways of this section are the following:
- Artificial neural network have existed for a long time.
- The two main components that made them "work" were the
  backpropagation algorithm (automatic differentiation) and the advent
  of more powerful computers.
- Artificial Neural Networks are huge derivable functions that we
  optimize using a variant of the Stochastic gradient descent
  algorithm.
